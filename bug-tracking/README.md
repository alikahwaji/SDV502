# Bug Tracking

Bugs and errors are common in any software or application. The trick is to handle these bugs effectively while keeping â€˜quality' the main objective of bug tracking. Software testers face challenges in bug reporting due to the growing number of new devices, including smartphones, wearables, and VR. Developers have to struggle while developing web applications due to the variation of screen sizes to fit with these devices. Bug tracking tools are available to ensure proper bug reporting.

Software developers keep track of all the problems and their solutions with the help of bug reporting. Thus, it makes bug reporting an essential part of the software development lifecycle. Organizations want to produce bug-free applications, which means happy customers. There are no applications without bugs, but developers are making their way to reduce the number of bugs appearing in the production of an application. For beginners, it is important to learn different ways in which bug reporting can be more effective and useful.  
 There are different ways to report a bug with proper workflow, let's have a look at them below:

## **Automated Browser Testing**

Just like its name suggests, automated bug reporting is all about setting up test cases that are automated and do not require any human intervention. It requires a set of the testing suite which allows testers to execute scripted tests on an application. Automated browser testing is done before releasing the app into production. Different automated tests can contribute to effective bug reporting.

## **Manual bug reporting**

Manual bug reporting involves testers recording and dealing with bugs in an application. human interaction is required to report bugs and issues, and also conduct various testing procedures. Testers require different testing and bug reporting tools in this process that is compatible with different operating systems. Manual bug reporting may be time-consuming but bug tracking tools are effective and work best for improving software quality.

## **Crowdsourced Testing**

Crowdsourced testing is an emerging concept in the software testing world. It involves bug reporting in real places. It outsources the testing activities to various bug reporters and testers in the field, who conduct actual tests on the application. The main advantage of using this method is to find out what experience users expect from an application. it uses a customer-centric approach so that successful products can be launched.
